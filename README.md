# About-me Quiz
 This is my first ever quiz app and 
 the first time in my life, I have voluntarily
 put some effort in a programming language.

 I wish things were taught the same way at school
 I could have learned so many things.
 fine---no use regretting.

# I learned---
* functions
loved the function analogy,
function is like a processing unit.
Aloo is input, you process it in the factory,
you get chips.
now the same Aloos' value is increased.
* for-loops
* arrays
* objects
